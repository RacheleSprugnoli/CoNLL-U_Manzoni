# CoNLL-U_Manzoni

This repository contains the output of an ongoing work aimed at creating a new dataset of the Alessandro Manzoni's novel "I Promessi Sposi" (The Betrothed) annotated with morpho-grammatical information.

Currently, the repository gives access to:
- chapters I, VIII and XXIII annotated with lemmas, part-of-speech tags and features following the Italian guidelines of [Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org/). The annotation was carried out by Flavio Massimiliano Cecchini under the supervision of Rachele Sprugnoli.
